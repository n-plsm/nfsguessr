## Notes
- Some maps might not be high resolution for multiple reasons,
the following versions might get that fixed though.

Maps that aren't finished yet are marked with `NF` (Not Finished),
this marking will be displayed in multiple situations, notably
in the file names for the maps.

a lot of effort is put into this project
